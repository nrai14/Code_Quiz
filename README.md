# Code Quiz 

## Description

As part of my journey to becoming a front-end web developer, I understand that it is very likely that I would be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. 

To help myself become familar with these tests, and apply skills learned from various resources so far, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
 

## User Story

```
AS aspiring front-end developer 
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score (currently working on trying to update local storage to do this)
